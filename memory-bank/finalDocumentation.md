## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend Optimizations

#### Memoization
- Used `React.memo` for components that don't need to re-render frequently
- Implemented `useMemo` for expensive calculations and style objects
- Created a custom `useMemoize` hook for memoizing functions with dependencies
- Applied the `memoize` utility function for pure functions like `formatTime`

#### Event Handler Optimizations
- Used `useCallback` for event handlers to maintain referential equality
- Implemented debouncing for input handlers with the `useDebounce` hook
- Applied throttling for scroll events and timeline interactions with the `useThrottle` hook

#### Lazy Loading
- Implemented lazy loading for video thumbnails using the `useLazyLoad` hook
- Added conditional rendering for components that aren't immediately visible
- Used the `loading="lazy"` attribute for images

#### Network Optimizations
- Implemented network status detection with the `useNetworkStatus` hook
- Added adaptive UI based on connection quality
- Provided offline feedback and functionality

#### Specific Component Optimizations

##### VideoEditor Component
- Memoized expensive calculations like `formatTime`
- Used React.memo for the TimelineItemComponent
- Memoized event handlers with useCallback
- Memoized style objects with useMemo
- Used throttling for video processing operations

##### LibraryPage Component
- Implemented lazy loading for video thumbnails
- Added debounced search functionality
- Applied throttling to scroll events
- Added network status detection with offline banner
- Optimized rendering with conditional content

### Backend Optimizations
- Implemented caching for API responses to reduce external API calls
- Optimized video processing with efficient FFmpeg commands
- Added memory management for large video processing jobs
- Implemented proper cleanup of temporary files

## Testing

### Testing Framework
- Jest for test runner and assertions
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Custom test utilities for common testing patterns

### Test Coverage

npm run setup-tests

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Deployment

### Requirements
- Node.js 16+
