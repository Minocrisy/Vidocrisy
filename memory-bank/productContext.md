# Product Context: Vidocrisy

## Purpose
Vidocrisy is a personal video generation platform that serves as a unified hub for creating, editing, and managing AI-generated videos.

- Online video creators (Canva, InVideo, Lumen5)
- AI avatar platforms (Synthesia, HeyGen, D-ID)

Vidocrisy differentiates by providing a unified interface specifically tailored to the user's needs and aesthetic preferences.

## Future Directions

- Advanced video editing capabilities
- Cloud-based storage and processing
- Collaborative features if expanded beyond personal use

## Notes
- The user has a Canva Pro account that can be leveraged for additional editing capabilities
