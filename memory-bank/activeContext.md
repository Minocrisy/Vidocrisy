## Active Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Chakra UI for a modern, customizable interface
- **Backend Technology**: Node.js with Express for API gateway and service integration
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg for video manipulation and splicing
- **Design Direction**: Futuristic, high-tech aesthetic with blue-tinted monochromatic color scheme
- **Development Environment**: GitHub Codespaces to minimize costs
- **Implementation Approach**: MVP first, focusing on Hedra integration and basic video splicing
- **UI/UX Approach**: Consistent animations, loading states, and visual feedback across all pages
- **Testing Approach**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests, with a focus on component functionality
- **Performance Optimization Approach**: 
  - Frontend: Memoization, debouncing, throttling, and lazy loading to improve responsiveness
  - Backend: Caching, memory management, and resource optimization for video processing
  - Adaptive experiences based on network status and device capabilities

## Current Challenges
- Applying performance optimizations to the most critical components
- Ensuring tests run successfully and provide meaningful coverage
- Balancing feature richness with development complexity for an MVP
- Implementing efficient video processing within GitHub Codespaces resource constraints
- Designing a system that's extensible for future AI service integrations
- Managing API usage to stay within the user's existing credits (implemented caching to help with this)
- Creating a seamless video splicing experience with easy-to-apply transitions
- Ensuring proper static file serving for images and assets
- Handling potential browser compatibility issues

## Open Questions
- Which components would benefit most from the performance optimizations?
- How should we prioritize the remaining tasks to maximize impact?
- What metrics should be used to evaluate the success of the performance optimizations?
- How should we handle continuous integration for automated testing?
- What specific performance optimizations should be applied to which components?
- How should we measure and monitor performance in production?
