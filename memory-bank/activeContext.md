# Active Context: Vidocrisy

## Current Focus
- Implementing Phase 1 (Foundation)
- Developing the basic UI framework with the user's visual style
- Setting up API integrations for Hedra and RunwayML

## Recent Changes
- Set up the project repository structure
- Initialized the React frontend with Vite and TypeScript
- Set up the Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript
- Configured the development environment
- Implemented the basic UI framework with the user's visual style
- Fixed image path issues in the frontend components
- Created proper environment configuration for both frontend and backend
- Renamed the project from "VideoGen" to "Vidocrisy" and updated all references throughout the codebase

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete the Hedra API integration
2. ✅ Implement the video generation form
3. ✅ Set up the video storage system
4. ✅ Create the video player component
5. ✅ Implement basic video editing capabilities
6. ✅ Add branding templates

## Active Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Chakra UI for a modern, customizable interface
- **Backend Technology**: Node.js with Express for API gateway and service integration
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg for video manipulation and splicing
- **Design Direction**: Futuristic, high-tech aesthetic with blue-tinted monochromatic color scheme
- **Development Environment**: GitHub Codespaces to minimize costs
- **Implementation Approach**: MVP first, focusing on Hedra integration and basic video splicing

## Current Challenges
- Balancing feature richness with development complexity for an MVP
- Implementing efficient video processing within GitHub Codespaces resource constraints
- Designing a system that's extensible for future AI service integrations
- Managing API usage to stay within the user's existing credits (implemented caching to help with this)
- Creating a seamless video splicing experience with easy-to-apply transitions
- Testing the Hedra API integration with real API keys

## Open Questions
- What specific transition effects should be prioritized for the initial implementation?
- How should video assets be organized and categorized in the system?
- What specific branding elements should be included in the intro/outro templates?
- How should we handle potential API rate limits and errors from the Hedra API?
- What metrics should be used to evaluate the success of the MVP?
- Should we implement a more robust error handling system for API failures?

## Recent Achievements
- Implemented the Hedra API integration with proper error handling
- Added caching to minimize API calls and reduce costs
- Created a user-friendly video generation form with avatar selection
- Implemented job status checking and video preview functionality
- Set up file upload capabilities for audio and images
- Created a comprehensive video storage system with metadata management
- Implemented a feature-rich video player component with custom controls
- Added video streaming capabilities with support for seeking and quality control
- Developed a video editor service with FFmpeg integration
- Implemented video concatenation, trimming, and transition effects
- Added branding capabilities with intro/outro and lower thirds
- Created a job system for tracking video processing progress
- Developed a drag-and-drop UI for video arrangement
- Implemented timeline-based video editing interface
- Added support for adding transitions between video clips
- Created output options for customizing video metadata

## Notes
- The user has existing avatars (Mike and Mira) with a futuristic, high-tech aesthetic
- The user's logo is black and white with a modern, angular design
- The user has a Canva Pro account that can be leveraged for additional editing
- The user wants to create short movie-style videos (around 3 minutes) and talking head videos
- The project should prioritize cost-effectiveness during development
- Implemented caching to reduce API calls and stay within credit limits
