# Active Context: VideoGen

## Current Focus
- Implementing Phase 1 (Foundation)
- Developing the basic UI framework with the user's visual style
- Setting up API integrations for Hedra and RunwayML

## Recent Changes
- Set up the project repository structure
- Initialized the React frontend with Vite and TypeScript
- Set up the Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript
- Configured the development environment
- Implemented the basic UI framework with the user's visual style
- Fixed image path issues in the frontend components
- Created proper environment configuration for both frontend and backend

## Next Steps
1. Complete the Hedra API integration
2. Implement the video generation form
3. Set up the video storage system
4. Create the video player component
5. Implement basic video editing capabilities
6. Add branding templates

## Active Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Chakra UI for a modern, customizable interface
- **Backend Technology**: Node.js with Express for API gateway and service integration
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg for video manipulation and splicing
- **Design Direction**: Futuristic, high-tech aesthetic with blue-tinted monochromatic color scheme
- **Development Environment**: GitHub Codespaces to minimize costs
- **Implementation Approach**: MVP first, focusing on Hedra integration and basic video splicing

## Current Challenges
- Balancing feature richness with development complexity for an MVP
- Implementing efficient video processing within GitHub Codespaces resource constraints
- Designing a system that's extensible for future AI service integrations
- Managing API usage to stay within the user's existing credits
- Creating a seamless video splicing experience with easy-to-apply transitions

## Open Questions
- What specific transition effects should be prioritized for the initial implementation?
- How should video assets be organized and categorized in the system?
- What specific branding elements should be included in the intro/outro templates?
- How should the system handle API rate limits and usage tracking?
- What metrics should be used to evaluate the success of the MVP?

## Notes
- The user has existing avatars (Mike and Mira) with a futuristic, high-tech aesthetic
- The user's logo is black and white with a modern, angular design
- The user has a Canva Pro account that can be leveraged for additional editing
- The user wants to create short movie-style videos (around 3 minutes) and talking head videos
- The project should prioritize cost-effectiveness during development
