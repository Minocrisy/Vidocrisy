2. ✅ Implement the video generation form
3. ✅ Set up the video storage system
4. ✅ Create the video player component
5. ✅ Implement basic video editing capabilities
6. ✅ Add branding templates
7. ✅ Implement export options with multiple formats and quality settings
8. ✅ Polish the UI/UX for HomePage and GeneratorPage
9. ⏳ Enhance UI/UX for EditorPage and LibraryPage
10. ⏳ Optimize performance for video processing
11. ⏳ Implement comprehensive testing

## Active Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Chakra UI for a modern, customizable interface
- **Backend Technology**: Node.js with Express for API gateway and service integration
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg for video manipulation and splicing
- **Design Direction**: Futuristic, high-tech aesthetic with blue-tinted monochromatic color scheme
- **Development Environment**: GitHub Codespaces to minimize costs
- **Implementation Approach**: MVP first, focusing on Hedra integration and basic video splicing

## Current Challenges
- Balancing feature richness with development complexity for an MVP
- Implementing efficient video processing within GitHub Codespaces resource constraints
- Designing a system that's extensible for future AI service integrations
- Managing API usage to stay within the user's existing credits (implemented caching to help with this)
- Creating a seamless video splicing experience with easy-to-apply transitions
- Ensuring proper static file serving for images and assets
- Handling potential browser compatibility issues

## Open Questions
- What specific transition effects should be prioritized for the initial implementation?
- How should video assets be organized and categorized in the system?
- What specific branding elements should be included in the intro/outro templates?
- How should we handle potential API rate limits and errors from the Hedra API?
- What metrics should be used to evaluate the success of the MVP?
- Should we implement a more robust error handling system for API failures?

## Notes
- The user has existing avatars (Mike and Mira) with a futuristic, high-tech aesthetic
- The user's logo is black and white with a modern, angular design
- The user has a Canva Pro account that can be leveraged for additional editing
- The user wants to create short movie-style videos (around 3 minutes) and talking head videos
- The project should prioritize cost-effectiveness during development
- Implemented caching to reduce API calls and stay within credit limits
