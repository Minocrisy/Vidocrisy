# Project Brief: VideoGen

## Overview
VideoGen is a personal video generation platform that integrates multiple AI video generation services (primarily Hedra, with RunwayML as a secondary option) into a unified interface. The platform will allow the user to generate, edit, splice, and brand videos with a focus on creating short movie-style and talking head videos.

## Core Requirements
- Integration with Hedra API for primary video generation
- Support for existing avatars (Mike and Mira)
- Video splicing functionality to combine multiple videos
- Easy-to-apply transitions between video segments
- Consistent branding at the beginning and end of all videos
- Video storage and organization system
- Basic video editing capabilities
- Mobile-friendly interface (for future deployment)

## Project Goals
- Create a personal video generation hub that simplifies the process of creating AI-generated videos
- Enable the creation of short movie-style videos (around 3 minutes) and talking head videos
- Provide flexibility to incorporate new AI tools in the future
- Maintain a sleek, modern interface with a design inspired by the user's existing brand
- Keep costs to a minimum by leveraging existing resources and free tiers where possible

## Target Audience
- Initially for personal use by the owner
- Potential for expansion to a wider audience in the future

## Success Criteria
- Successful integration with Hedra API
- Ability to generate talking head videos using Mike and Mira avatars
- Functional video splicing with transitions
- Consistent branding application
- Intuitive user interface with modern design
- Cost-effective implementation and operation

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation - Project setup, UI framework, Hedra API integration
- Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Core Video Features - Video storage, player, branding tool
- Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Editing & Splicing - Video combining, transitions, arrangement
- Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): Refinement & Testing - UI polish, performance optimization, testing

## Notes
- The user has access to Hedra and RunwayML APIs with $20 in credits for each
- The user has a Canva Pro account that can be leveraged for additional editing
- The user has a Google Cloud project that could be utilized if needed
- The project should be developed in GitHub Codespaces to minimize costs
- The user has existing avatars (Mike and Mira) and a black and white logo
