## Known Issues
- Some non-critical 404 errors still appear in the console for certain assets
- TypeScript type definitions for some components need improvement
- Potential resource constraints in GitHub Codespaces for video processing
- API usage limits will need careful management (caching implemented to help)
- Video storage strategy needs refinement as project progresses
- Error handling for API failures could be more robust
- Need to test UI responsiveness on various screen sizes and devices
- Animation performance on lower-end devices may need optimization
- EditorPage and LibraryPage UI/UX need enhancement to match the quality of HomePage and GeneratorPage
- Need to implement more comprehensive form validation throughout the application

## Testing Status
- Testing plan defined in technical documentation
- No tests implemented yet (pre-development)

## Notes
- The project will follow an iterative development approach
- Initial focus will be on creating a functional MVP with Hedra integration
- User feedback will be incorporated throughout the development process
- Cost-effectiveness is a priority throughout implementation
- The system should be designed for extensibility to incorporate additional AI services in the future
