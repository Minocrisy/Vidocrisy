## Known Issues
- Some non-critical 404 errors still appear in the console for certain assets
- TypeScript type definitions for some components need improvement
- Potential resource constraints in GitHub Codespaces for video processing
- API usage limits will need careful management (caching implemented to help)
- Video storage strategy needs refinement as project progresses
- Error handling for API failures could be more robust
- Animation performance on lower-end devices may need optimization
- Need to implement more comprehensive form validation throughout the application

## Testing Status
- Testing plan defined in technical documentation
- Test suite framework set up with Jest and React Testing Library
- Initial test cases implemented for HomePage, LibraryPage, ExportDialog, and VideoPlayer components
- Setup script created for installing testing dependencies and running tests
- TypeScript configuration updated to enable esModuleInterop for testing
- Jest and Babel configuration files created for ES module support
- Fixed test issues in LibraryPage, HomePage, ExportDialog, and VideoPlayer components
- Fixed issues with Chakra UI hooks in test files
- Used more specific selectors in tests to handle ambiguous elements
- Updated tests to check for state changes rather than implementation details
- All tests are now passing successfully
- Need to implement additional test cases as outlined in the test suite documentation
- Need to set up continuous integration for automated testing

## Performance Optimization Status
- Performance optimization utilities implemented for video processing
- Backend optimization utilities implemented for memory management, API optimization, and database operations
- Frontend performance optimization utilities implemented:
  - Memoization for expensive computations
  - Debouncing for limiting function calls
  - Throttling for high-frequency events
  - Lazy loading for images and components
  - FPS monitoring
  - Network status detection
- React hooks created for performance optimization:
  - useDebounce for form inputs and search
  - useThrottle for scroll events
  - useMemoize for expensive calculations
  - useLazyLoad for viewport-based loading
  - useReducedMotion for accessibility
  - useFPS for performance monitoring
  - useIdle for resource management
  - usePageVisibility for background optimization

- Need to apply these optimizations to critical components:
  - VideoEditor component (memoization, throttling)
  - LibraryPage (lazy loading, virtualization)
  - Search inputs (debouncing)
  - Timeline interactions (throttling)
  - Network-dependent features (adaptive loading)

## Notes
- The project will follow an iterative development approach
- Initial focus will be on creating a functional MVP with Hedra integration
- User feedback will be incorporated throughout the development process
- Cost-effectiveness is a priority throughout implementation
- The system should be designed for extensibility to incorporate additional AI services in the future
- UI/UX improvements have been implemented consistently across all pages
- Next focus will be on applying performance optimizations to critical components and finalizing documentation
