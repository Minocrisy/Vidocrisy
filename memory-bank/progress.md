# Progress: VideoGen

## Project Status
- Planning phase completed
- Phase 1 (Foundation) implementation in progress
- Basic UI framework implemented
- Frontend and backend structure set up

## What Works
- Project planning and documentation
- Architecture and technology stack defined
- Implementation approach established
- Visual direction determined based on user's existing assets
- React frontend with Vite and TypeScript
- Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript
- Development environment configuration
- Basic UI framework with user's visual style
- Environment variables configuration

## Current Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Project Planning | Week 0 | âœ… Completed |
| Foundation Implementation | End of Week 2 | ðŸ”„ In Progress (60%) |
| Core Video Features | End of Week 4 | ðŸ”„ Not Started |
| Editing & Splicing | End of Week 6 | ðŸ”„ Not Started |
| MVP Completion | End of Week 8 | ðŸ”„ Not Started |

## Known Issues
- Image path handling in the public directory requires careful attention
- TypeScript type definitions for some components need improvement
- Potential resource constraints in GitHub Codespaces for video processing
- API usage limits will need careful management
- Video storage strategy needs refinement as project progresses

## Testing Status
- Testing plan defined in technical documentation
- No tests implemented yet (pre-development)

## Notes
- The project will follow an iterative development approach
- Initial focus will be on creating a functional MVP with Hedra integration
- User feedback will be incorporated throughout the development process
- Cost-effectiveness is a priority throughout implementation
- The system should be designed for extensibility to incorporate additional AI services in the future
