# Test Suite: Vidocrisy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test suite for the Vidocrisy application. The test suite is designed to ensure the application functions correctly, provides a good user experience, and meets all requirements.

## Testing Approach
We will use a combination of testing methodologies:
1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components and services
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user workflows
4. **UI/UX Testing**: Testing the user interface and experience
5. **Performance Testing**: Testing the application's performance under various conditions

## Testing Tools
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing (planned for future implementation)
- **Lighthouse**: For performance testing (planned for future implementation)
- **Axe**: For accessibility testing (planned for future implementation)

## Implementation Status

### Current Status
- Test suite framework set up with Jest and React Testing Library
- Initial test cases implemented for HomePage, LibraryPage, ExportDialog, and VideoPlayer components
- Setup script created for installing testing dependencies and running tests
- TypeScript configuration updated to enable esModuleInterop for testing
- Jest and Babel configuration files created for ES module support
- TypeScript errors in test files need to be resolved
- Tests need to be run and issues fixed

### Configuration Changes
- Updated tsconfig.json to enable esModuleInterop and allowSyntheticDefaultImports
- Created jest.config.cjs for proper ES module support
- Created babel.config.cjs for transpiling TypeScript and React code
- Updated package.json scripts to use the new configuration files
- Modified setupTests.ts to work with TypeScript and ES modules

### Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript errors in test files
2. Run the test suite and fix any issues
3. Implement additional test cases as outlined in the test plan
4. Set up continuous integration for automated testing

## Common Test Issues and Solutions

### TypeScript Errors in Test Files
- **Issue**: TypeScript errors related to module imports and type definitions
- **Solution**: 
  - Enable esModuleInterop and allowSyntheticDefaultImports in tsconfig.json
  - Use proper ES module syntax for imports
  - Add type definitions for test-specific functions and components
  - Use @ts-ignore or @ts-expect-error for third-party libraries without proper types

### Jest Configuration for ES Modules
- **Issue**: Jest doesn't work properly with ES modules
- **Solution**:
  - Use jest.config.cjs instead of jest.config.js
  - Configure transformIgnorePatterns to handle node_modules
  - Set up babel-jest for transpiling
  - Use proper extensionsToTreatAsEsm configuration

### Mock Implementation Issues
- **Issue**: Mocks not working as expected
- **Solution**:
  - Use jest.mock() at the top of the file
  - Implement mockImplementation() for complex functions
  - Reset mocks between tests with beforeEach()
  - Use spyOn() for method mocks

### React Testing Library Best Practices
- Use screen.getByRole() instead of getByTestId() when possible
- Test user interactions with userEvent instead of fireEvent
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
- Use waitFor() for asynchronous operations

## Conclusion
This test suite provides a comprehensive approach to testing the Vidocrisy application. By implementing and executing these tests, we can ensure that the application meets all requirements, provides a good user experience, and performs well under various conditions.

The current focus is on fixing TypeScript errors in test files, running the tests, and addressing any issues that arise. Once the basic test suite is working, we can expand it to include more comprehensive tests for all components and features.
